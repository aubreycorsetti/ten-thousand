Welcome to Ten Thousand
(y)es to play or (n)o to decline
> y
# Idea wise- what do we need to do?
# invite_to_play() -> return a y or n (alternitavly T/F)
# if n then decline_game()
# else start_game()

# def start_game():
# total_score = 0
# loop for round_num in given number of rounds
#   round_score = do_round(round_num, function_to_roll_dice)
#   if round_score was a quit (I used -1) then
#       return
#   complete_round(round_num, total_score, round_score) show stats
#       end_game(total_score)

Starting round 1 # start_round(round_num, function_to_roll_dice) -> round_score or quit
